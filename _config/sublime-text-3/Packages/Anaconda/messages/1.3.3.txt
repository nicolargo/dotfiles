Changes in 1.3.3
================

- Vagrant Support Fixed
- Added imports validation mechanism, resolves https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda/issues/216
- Added imports validation to Vagrant Server

**notes**: Some times, the imports validation mechanism doesn't work too well
with relative imports, because that, you can add `# noqa` at the end of an
import that is mark as invalid if you are sure that anaconda is not handling
well relative paths
